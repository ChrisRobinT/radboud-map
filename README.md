# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Radboud Campus Map

## Description
In our current school environment here at Radboud Universiteit, there are no truly effective ways to find your way around campus. Sure, the university does provide a PDF campus map, but that map is non-interactive, and also non-optimized for mobile devices. This means that figuring out where a specific building is, and by extension finding a specific room in a building for a class can be quite challenging for newer students or people visiting campus. To tackle this problem head-on, our group set out to develop a mobile friendly, interactive web application that allows users to: 
1. Quickly locate any building or any room decided upon important buildings on the Radboud campus via a searchable map interface.  
2. View detailed room-level and building-level information, including bathroom accessibility and dining facilities for some important buildings.  
3. Accurate room codes and locations that match pretty well with most students’ schedules.
