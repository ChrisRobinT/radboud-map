# Radboud Map

## Name
Radboud Campus Map

## Description
In our current school environment here at Radboud Universiteit, there are no truly effective ways to find your way around campus. Sure, the university does provide a PDF campus map, but that map is non-interactive, and also non-optimized for mobile devices. This means that figuring out where a specific building is, and by extension finding a specific room in a building for a class can be quite challenging for newer students or people visiting campus. To tackle this problem head-on, our group set out to develop a mobile friendly, interactive web application that allows users to: 
1. Quickly locate any building or any room decided upon important buildings on the Radboud campus via a searchable map interface.  
2. View detailed room-level and building-level information, including bathroom accessibility and dining facilities for some important buildings.  
3. Accurate room codes and locations that match pretty well with most students’ schedules.
